# :dragon::robot: DRGN-AI: _Ab initio_ cryo-EM reconstruction #

DRGN-AI is a neural network-based algorithm for _ab initio_ heterogeneous cryo-EM reconstruction. The
method leverages the expressive representation capacity of neural models and implements a two-stage joint inference procedure of poses and heterogeneous conformational states to enable single-shot reconstruction of noisy, large cryo-EM datasets. 

## Documentation ##

The latest detailed documentation for DRGN-AI is available [on gitbook](https://ez-lab.gitbook.io/drgn-ai/), 
including an overview and walkthrough of DRGN-AI installation, training and analysis. A brief quick start is
provided below.


## New in Version 1.0.0 ##

 - Add `--datadir` to `drgnai setup`
 - Remove `outdir` from the `config.yaml`
 - Allow arbitrary config parameters to be passed to `drgnai setup`
 - Add `--load` in `drgnai train` for auto-restart of experiments
 - Renaming of old experiments in the same output folder as `old-out_000_fixed-homo/`, `old-out_001_abinit-het4/`, `...`
   instead of just `out_old/`


### New in Version 0.2.2-beta ###

 - `drgnai filter` interface for interactive filtering of particles
 - Support for `$DRGNAI_DATASETS` dataset catalogue
 - Cleaner tracking of configuration specifications


## Installation ##

We recommend installing DRGN-AI in a clean conda environment ‚Äî first clone the latest stable version available in 
the git repository, and then use `pip` to install the package from the source code:

    (base) $ conda create --name drgnai python=3.9
    (base) $ conda activate drgnai
    (drgnai) $ git clone https://github.com/ml-struct-bio/drgnai.git
    (drgnai) $ cd drgnai/
    (drgnai) $ pip install . 

To confirm that the package was installed successfully, use `drgnai test`:

```
(drgnai) $ drgnai test
Installation was successful!
```

You may also choose to define an environment variable `$DRGNAI_DATASETS` in your bash environment, which will allow you
to point to a file listing locations of input files and dataset labels to use as shortcuts. For more information, 
see our [detailed user guide](https://ez-lab.gitbook.io/drgn-ai/).


## Usage ##

This package installs the `drgnai` command line tool for running experiments, which contains three key subcommands:

 - `drgnai setup` creates the experiment folder and configuration parameter file
 - `drgnai train` trains and analyzes a reconstruction model
 - `drgnai analyze` performs specific analyses in addition to those done by `train`

As cryo-EM reconstruction experiments are usually computationally intensive, `train` especially is most
commonly used within a script submitted to a job scheduling system on a high-performance compute cluster.


### Setup ###

First, use the `drgnai setup` tool to create an output directory and a configuration file for DRGN-AI. 

```
drgnai setup your_outdir --particles /my_data/particles.mrcs --ctf /my_data/ctf.pkl \
                     --capture-setup spa --conf-estimation autodecoder \
                     --pose-estimation abinit --reconstruction-type het                               
```

This command will create an output directory called `your_outdir` and a configuration file `your_outdir/configs.yaml`:

```yaml
particles: /my_data/particles.mrcs
ctf: /my_data/ctf.pkl
quick_config:
  capture_setup: spa
  conf_estimation: autodecoder
  pose_estimation: abinit
  reconstruction_type: het
```

### Reconstruction and analysis ###

After setup is complete, run the experiment using `drgnai train your_outdir`. 

```
drgnai train your_outdir
```

DRGN-AI will save the outputs of training under `your_outdir/out/`. By default, at the end of training, DRGN-AI will analyze the results from the last epoch. 


You can also run analyses on a particular training epoch instead of the last epoch. Outputs of each analysis will be stored under 
`your_outdir/out/analysis_<epoch>/`.

```
drgnai analyze your_outdir --epoch 25
```

### Monitoring running experiments ###

The progress of model training can be tracked using the `your_outdir/out/training.log` file.

The training step can also be monitored while it is running using Tensorboard, which is installed as part of DRGN-AI,
by following these steps:

1. Run the command `tensorboard --logdir out-dir/out --port 6565 --bind_all` remotely, where out-dir is the experiment 
output directory and 6565 is an arbitrary port number.
2. Run the command `ssh -NfL 6565:<server-name>:6565 <user-name>@<server-address>` locally, using the same port number 
   above, and replacing the server info with your own.
3. Navigate to localhost:6565 in your local browser to access the tensorboard interface.


## Advanced Configuration ##

The behavior of the algorithm can be modified by passing different values to `drgnai setup` at the beginning of the
experiment. However, only the most important parameters are available through this interface:

 - `--capture-setup` ‚Äúspa‚Äù for single-particle analysis (default, only version supported for the moment)
 - `--reconstruction-type` ‚Äúhet‚Äù for heterogeneous or ‚Äúhomo‚Äù for homogeneous (default)
 - `--pose-estimation` ‚Äúabinit‚Äù for no initialization (default), ‚Äúrefine‚Äù to refine provided poses by gradient
                       descent or ‚Äúfixed‚Äù to use provided poses without refinement
 - `--conf-estimation` ‚Äúautodecoder‚Äù (default), ‚Äúencoder‚Äù or ‚Äúrefine‚Äù to refine conformations by
                       gradient descent (you must then define initial_conf) ‚Äî not used in homogeneous reconstruction

Note that each argument can be specified using a non-ambiguous prefix as a shortcut üòÉ, e.g.
```
drgnai setup out-dir --dataset 50S_128 --cap spa --conf autodecoder \
                     --pose-estim abinit --reconstr het
```

To change the other configuration parameters, the `configs.yaml` file must be edited directly before the experiment
is run. For a full overview of how to configure the parameters used in the DRGN-AI model, see the
[docs](https://ez-lab.gitbook.io/drgn-ai/configuration).
